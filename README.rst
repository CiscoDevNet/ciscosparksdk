-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ciscosparksdk** is a *community developed* Python Software Development Kit
for working with the `Cisco Spark`_ cloud collaboration platform.  It extends
the capabilities of the `ciscosparkapi`_ API wrapper to include additional
tools and methods that make working with Cisco Spark via Python even more
enjoyable!


Project & Package Status
------------------------

**Alpha!**  Tread lightly.  ðŸ˜ƒ

This project is currently under initial alpha-level development.  Expect the
package APIs to change.  Expect bugs.  Help us squash them and add features!


Features
--------

ciscosparksdk enhances your developer experience by providing:

+ Convenience objects and methods that make interacting with Cisco Spark a
  python-native and natural experience.  For example:

  + Access your Spark rooms using builtin "rooms list" convenience objects.

  + Instead of having to locate and pass around object IDs, like when you want
    to create a message in room and you have to find and then provide the
    room's ID to the create-message API, why not just have a ``create_message``
    convenience method available underneath your room object so you can simply
    say ``room.create_message()`` or ``room.add_person()``?  We do that.  ðŸ˜Ž

+ We also provide a community framework for capturing and contributing
  solutions to common needs that often arise when working with Cisco Spark.

Community Development
---------------------

Want to find a room by name?  Why should all of us write the same functions
over and over again?  Let's do it once, iterate the solutions if they can be
improved, and save all of us time and effort while contributing and increasing
the quality of the code we all use.

Installation
------------

Installing and upgrading ciscosparksdk is easy:

**Install via PIP**

.. code-block:: bash
